PayPal iOS SDK release notes
============================

2.13.0
------
* Add nullability annotations to headers
* Minor internal code cleanup

2.12.9
------
* Fix issue determining valid negative amounts. See [issue #369](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/369).

2.12.8
------
* Update network code and general code cleanup

2.12.7
------
* Update networking code for iOS 7 to fix potential ClassicURLConnection crash

2.12.6
------
* When the wrong PayPal login credentials are used, use shake animation
  and allow user to login again without having to click on Pay button again

2.12.5
------
* In CocoaPods, add subspecs to allow PayPal SDK to be used without card.io. By
  default, all libraries are included. If you do not want to use card.io, use
  the `Core` subspec like `PayPal-iOS-SDK/Core` in your Podfile. See the
  SampleApp without card.io to see how you can setup your application without
  credit card scanning. See [issue #358](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/358).
* Update to use NSURLSession whenever possible. Falls back to NSURLConnection for iOS 6.

2.12.4
------
* Split card.io libraries into 3 different libraries to help reduce the size of the individual files. [issue #339](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/339)
  You should link to `libPayPalMobile.a`, `libCardIO.a`, `libopencv_core.a', and `libopencv_imgproc.a` for your app now. See notes in 2.12.2 for more information.
* Fix issue with iOS 6 API availability with call to initWithBase64EncodedData:options: [issue #351](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/351)
* Switch to use vendored_libraries in `PayPal-iOS-SDK.podspec` to help some CocoaPod issues

2.12.3
------
* Fixed long string description text wrapping for iOS9
* Updated Swift Sample App to Swift 2.0 syntax
* Fixed cocoapods spec file to unzip libCardIO.a.zip when installing for dependency resolution
* Parsing enhancement for empty response received from server APIs

2.12.2
------
* There are now 2 static libraries which you should link to your application:
  - `libPayPalMobile.a` in the `PayPalMobile` directory
  - `libCardIO.a` in the `CardIO` directory. Please unzip the `libCardIO.a.zip` archive.
* `libPayPalMobile.a` is a required static library which has all the previous PayPal functionality using the REST APIs
* `libCardIO.a` is an optional static library. If you want to allow payments by scanning credit cards, you must also
  link this library. It is currently zipped in a `libCardIO.a.zip` file. Use a standard unzip tool to unzip
  `CardIO\libCardIO.a.zip` to get `libCardIO.a`.
* If you want the same functionality which you had before in version 2.12.1, link to both `libPayPalMobile.a` and
  `libCardIO.a`. You must use the `libPayPalMobile.a` and `libCardIO.a` from the same SDK.
* Bitcode enabled the libraries. While the static libraries are larger, the application delivered to users should not
  be significantly different in size compared to before. [Issue #284](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/284)
* You must use Xcode 7.0 with these versions of the SDK. For Xcode 6.4, you can use the 2.11.x libraries but it is
  advised that you upgrade as soon as possible. Xcode 6.4 is not compatible with Bitcode enabled libraries.

* Built using Xcode 7.0
* Use `SFSafariViewController` via `SafariServices.framework` (if linked) for opening web pages
* Fixed behavior where `retrieve_shipping_address ` is disabled and no `shipping address` is provided from the app,
  so it will not default to the PayPal account `shipping address`.

2.11.5

* Note this is the same code as 2.12.1 except built with Xcode 6.4 [issue #327](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/327)
